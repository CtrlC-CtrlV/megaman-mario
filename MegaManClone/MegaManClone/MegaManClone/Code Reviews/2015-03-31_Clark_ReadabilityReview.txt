Specific comments on readability:
+ Collapsible regions keep the properties and the constructor out of the way.
+ The numerous methods are short enough to be easily digested and understood.
+ The use of the CollisionHelper simplifies the BlockMovement method and makes it easy to understand the different collision cases.

-Without digging deeper into the code, it can be a little confusing to see empty methods.

Simple implementation of sound effects at exactly the right spot in the stack, although the particular sound
	made by the large MM when he falls can get kinda annoying ;)

I don't think it is necessary to save a reference to the whole ContentManager in the constructor. Instead,
	load the necessary content in the constructor and save it for later use. This has the added benefit of
	re-using the same SoundEffect object every time a sound is played rather than calling content.Load
	every time.

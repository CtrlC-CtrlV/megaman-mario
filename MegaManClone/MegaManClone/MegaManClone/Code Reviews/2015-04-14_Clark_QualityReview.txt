Specific comments on quality.
Good
I like that the only responsibility of the HUD it to draw the information.

Hypothetical improvement.
Instead of hardcoded positions, the position could be determined by being placed at a certain percentage of the width/height of the viewport. 
This would help with scaling and different resolutions.

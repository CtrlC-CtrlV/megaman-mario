Specific comments on readability.  
	- Overall pretty readable. Starting to get pretty long, though, in terms of LOCs, not sure how important of a metric that is though, especially within a game.  
	- One line implementations look pretty :)
	- Variables are obviously very self-documenting, which is great and makes it extremely easy to read.
	- Documentation would be cool for when we hover over methods and whatnot
	- Transitions should probably all be organized together

Has a low cyclomatic complexity of 10, and has rather low coupling as well (9 classes). For a relatively small class (only 26 LOC) it's a pretty clean and sensible approach to the problem.
The ability to move not only left and right but also up and down is a very nice addition that could be useful in sprint 5.

The only hypothetical improvements I could think of would be possibly more descriptive variable names (backgroundFrame isn't super clear) but that may fall under readability. It's good code.

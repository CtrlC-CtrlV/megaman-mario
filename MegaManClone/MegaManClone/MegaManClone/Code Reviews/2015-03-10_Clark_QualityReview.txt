Specific comments on quality.
Good

Hypothetical improvement.
Inside parseXML method, change the if statement for parsing megaman into a for loop in the case that multiple megamans (multiplayer) need to be added.

Instead of Determine"Object"Type methods, a factory could be used to return an instance of the correct sprite/object.

Specific comments on readability:
+ Collapsible regions keep the properties and the constructor out of the way.
+ They also make the foreach loop easier to look at and dissect without being terribly overwhelmed by the large if/else cases.
+ Several methods were created which helps to break up the code into manageable chunks.

-Possibly rearrange methods so that methods with similar tasks (DetermineItemType, DetermineBlockType, etc) are closer together.
	This would make it a little easier to digest all of the methods that the class has. 
-Another option would be to combine some of the similarly tasked methods into a new class to break up the longer StageFactory class.

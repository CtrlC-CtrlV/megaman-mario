Name of file: 
	4 Megaman Test Files
	- BlockCollision.cs
	- EnemyColission.cs
	- ItemCollision.cs
	- UnitTest1.cs
Author of file: Anna Baker w/modifications by Shane Clark

Specific comments on quality:
	- Readable
	- 2/7 tests currently pass.
	- Some methods not yet completed.

Hypothetical improvement:
	- Potentially automate simluated user input to cause collisions between megaman and various objects.
	- Potentially start megaman in a falling state for some instances to easy testing of colission with tops of objects?
